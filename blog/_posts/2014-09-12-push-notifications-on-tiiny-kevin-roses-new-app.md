<a href="tiiny.com" target="_blank">Tiiny</a> is a fun new mini-app by Kevin Rose&#8217;s new company, which creates a wall of fun looping micro-videos from your friends and follow-ees that <a href="https://twitter.com/staringispolite/status/510500681623408640" target="_blank">somehow feels very familiar&#8230;</a>

It&#8217;s new, so there&#8217;s a TON of notifications on the app, which gave me some serious <a href="bit.ly/1nR5Opf" target="_blank">notification fatigue</a>. But perhaps more interestingly, I don&#8217;t even remember allowing push notifications. At first I thought I was crazy, but it came up again on the <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/tiiny" target="_blank">ProductHunt thread</a>. In a (very informal) poll I just did around the office, only 1 in 6 people remembered allowing push notifications in the on-boarding flow.

But it turns out we all definitely did. The notifications popup shows at the exact moment that we&#8217;re shown the wall of our friends loading.

My working theory: it&#8217;s a novel instance of classic misdirection. We&#8217;ve been trained by years of popups to quickly dismiss them (Sure you want to close this tab? Review our app! Really delete this file? Join my mailing list!&#8230;). Combine that with the powerful draw of gifs popping up in the background, most of which are faces looking directly at you, and you&#8217;ve got a powerful misdirection effect. If this is actually a repeatable phenomenon, then with great power comes great responsibility. What do you think: real phenomenon or coincidence? Evil genius, or happy accident?
