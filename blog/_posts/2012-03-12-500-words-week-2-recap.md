I cannot believe its been another week already. I almost forgot to do this recap, since it didn&#8217;t feel like another week had passed yet. Interestingly, I feel like I&#8217;m running out of things to say. Or rather, I&#8217;ve used up the low hanging fruit and now I have to be more introspective. Overall, I&#8217;m past the honeymoon period &#8211; I&#8217;m no longer raving about how different I feel or how productive I am &#8211; but I&#8217;m still being productive, and still agree with all <a title="500 words. Week 1 recap." href="http://staringispolite.com/blog/2012/03/05/500-words-week-1-recap/" target="_blank">the benefits I talked about in Week 1</a>. I think I&#8217;m just starting to integrate it into my life is all. I was initially worried whether I was going to be able to really stick with this, either by running out of things to say or by sleeping in. Now I feel confident in my ability to finish this thing out.

Now I need to start smoothing things out into a sustainable lifestyle (expand beyond personal projects, keep up with the healthy food & cooking, probably lower my productivity standards just a bit to make room for unforeseen circumstances or impromptu plans). I&#8217;d like to block out estimates for a week&#8217;s worth of goals ahead of time too, even though it&#8217;s against my nature, so I can have more of a sense of progress & purpose.

What went well:

**Woke up at 8:30 or earlier every day**. Could&#8217;ve been more consistent if I hadn&#8217;t had that very early meeting, but I knowingly made that sacrifice for the experience.

**Morning sunlight & my sleep cycle.** Opening up my curtains to get bright sunshine in every morning really helped me get going in the morning. I used to spend my writing time in the dark, waking up. Now, it&#8217;s honestly pretty similar at first. But the sunlight transitions me to awake mode faster, and I do think it helps solidify your sleep cycle (a trick I learned from FlightCaster founder Jason Freedman in <a href="http://www.humbledmba.com/become-a-morning-person-how-to-end-insomnia-f" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.) I even woke up around 6am by my own accord. TWICE this week. Once I can get my falling-asleep time under control, I&#8217;ll move my morning routine up again.

**Food!** I had an unofficial goal to make food for myself every meal of last week, M-F. And I did it! It felt so great. To some degree it was a time sink. I probably spent an extra 4 hours over the course of the week on cooking. But the amount of satisfaction I got from eating healthier and learning new recipes was totally worth it.

**Rediscovered that I can be exhausted and happy at the same time**, if I&#8217;m working on the right things. I need to remember that the universal &#8220;ugh I only got X hours of sleep last night, I&#8217;m so grumpy&#8221; is masking &#8220;AND I don&#8217;t want to be doing what I&#8217;m doing right now&#8221;. I do a fine job of recognizing when I need sleep, by napping or cutting things out of my schedule. What I DON&#8217;T do enough of is deal with the second half, even if &#8220;deal with&#8221; just means &#8220;acknowledge it and finish the task so you can follow your excitement more.&#8221;

Experiment: **Does forcing yourself to write about personal stuff actually uncover things you have to say?** In fact, I think it does. I transitioned into writing about at least one personal thing per day, and somehow always had something to write about if I waited long enough. Often these were things I didn&#8217;t realize I was pissed about until I started writing, then I&#8217;d realize &#8220;Wait a minute, I really do care about X thing&#8221;, then I&#8217;d deal with the situation and feel better. The other benefit of this twist: even if it was something I already knew I was pissed about, it would help me focus my thoughts, and get all the anger out on paper, so when I actually bring something up, I&#8217;d have much better results.

**Goals**. I wrote up some <a title="Goals" href="http://staringispolite.com/blog/goals/" target="_blank">draft long-term goals</a> to keep me focused and help prioritize my day to day, based on the idea I had last week (and inspired by our quarterly goal system at work). Except that for these, I&#8217;m only allowed to have three at a time, and I won&#8217;t be allowed to move on to the next three until the first three are accomplished. The daily goals are going great. I grade them every morning with green/yellow/red for done/middle/not done, then set goals for the current day. Keeps things focused, but **I&#8217;d like to have more of an idea ahead of time, like planning out the week.** I also noticed that I was feeling stressed about all the things I wanted to accomplish, but wasn&#8217;t getting to. So I wrote a massive list of every single thing I could think of. I called it &#8220;<a title="“The List”" href="http://staringispolite.com/blog/the-list/" target="_blank">The List</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s stupid, but I actually feel great having it written down somewhere.

&nbsp;

What could&#8217;ve gone better:

**I feel torn in multiple directions this week**. I could&#8217;ve finished more actual goals of mine if I focused on them. For instance, I&#8217;m almost done with the polish on staringispolite.com. I probably have ~6 more hours left between visual polish, FTP setup, and a deploy script. But I spent that time on a side-project I have slated for April instead, because my partner was excited about it. Not sure what the takeaway is here, except to **prioritize & estimate** how long I need for my remaining Q1 goals, and make sure I have a plan for finishing them. If I have that, I don&#8217;t have to feel guilty about taking time away for other things

**Life balance.** I did great with work, personal projects, and health this week. Need to probably dial back the productivity in favor of relaxing time with friends. If left to my own devices, I&#8217;d have stayed in and hacked on stuff all weekend. I need to consciously work in **(1) time to catch up with people, and (2) a goal to start reading before bed by a certain time.**

**Consumption breaks, or mixing producing with consuming.** Mostly right when I come home from work and am making food, I get bored and put on a show on hulu. No big deal except it starts the momentum going in the direction of consumption. Then I watch another show while I&#8217;m eating. Then it&#8217;s harder to produce afterwards. **Pick days when I&#8217;m going to just relax and consume content, and come home to do that guilt-free**. The other days, pick something else to fill that time, like stretching from the bike-ride home.

**More sense of direction**. Plan out the week ahead. Adapt as I go if need be, but always see where I&#8217;m going and where today&#8217;s piece fits in.

&nbsp;

**New rule
  
** I already read every night before I go to sleep. But now I have to start doing this by midnight, which means I&#8217;ll have to stop working around 11:30.
