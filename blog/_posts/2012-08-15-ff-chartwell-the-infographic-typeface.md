FF Chartwell is essentially a clever hack on ligatures. For example, in some fonts an &#8216;f&#8217; followed by an &#8216;i&#8217; gets cluttered by the f&#8217;s bar overlapping with the i, or not aligning right. So fonts auto-magically replace the &#8216;f&#8217; and &#8216;i&#8217; with one glyph &#8216;fi&#8217;. (That almost certainly didn&#8217;t happen in your browser just now, but you can learn more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature" target="_blank">ligatures on Wikipedia</a>)

Except in this case, using a feature of the OpenType standard, FF Chartwell turns the ligatures dial up to 11. In FF Chartwell Pies, text like &#8220;25+30+25+20&#8243; gets turned into a pie chart with those numbers interpreted as percents. In FF Chartwell Bars, those same numbers would get turned into a bar graph, and so on. The graphics you create inherit the colors of the text you typed, and the text is preserved, you can simply toggle those ligatures on/off to edit the original.
