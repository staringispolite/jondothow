Dear diary: Almost 54 days without restarting my Macbook Pro.

Skype&#8217;s chat UI changes when I unplug the power; Chrome has begun aribtrarily turning webpages to flat white. There are equally bizarre workarounds for each, but I am finally giving in and restarting.

Goodnight, sweet prince. You&#8217;ve had a good run.
