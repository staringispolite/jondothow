    My company, <a href="http://www.emissarymed.com" target="_blank">Emissary</a>, works out of a great co-working space called the Founder&#8217;s Dojo. We organize periodic fireside chats with great people in the startup world. Below are my (raw/unedited) notes from our first talk. The topic was pre-seed and seed funding, with <a href="https://twitter.com/sshreibati" target="_blank">Sammy Shreibati</a> of <a href="https://www.saveup.com/" target="_blank">SaveUp.com</a></div>

      &#8211;<br /> <strong>Advice to entrepreneurs looking to raise?</strong><br /> Create momentum.<br /> Don&#8217;t tell them who you&#8217;re talking to. They won&#8217;t collude but they&#8217;ll get together, share notes, etc. They&#8217;ll eventually get there anyway, but no need to speed the process up.<br /> Expected value of that situation is not necessarily worse, but it&#8217;s not a better outcome for the entrepreneur.<br /> ***Getting to the first term sheet should be your goal***

      <strong>SaveUp&#8217;s 1st round<br /> </strong>Talked to 15 investors in 2.5 weeks<br /> Mid-2011, &#8220;frothy&#8221; time when lots of deals were happening<br /> TrueVentures (seed), Blue Run (series A for Paypal)<br /> Mostly Sand Hill, some SF.<br /> Felt good to go up to them and say we&#8217;re talking to others<br /> Once you get first term sheet you&#8217;re good.<br /> Pre-product: bought adwords for different keywords, sent traffic to email signups, showed analytics as proxy for interest. This also got Sammy to really believe in it.<br /> Reminds me of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/convince.html" target="_blank">http://www.paulgraham.com/<wbr>convince.html<br /> </wbr></a>There was also a ton of literature on Prize Linked Savings which is the inspiration of SaveUp. That helped pre-product. </p> 
      
      <p>
        <strong><!--more-->How&#8217;d you get the intros? How do you approach first contact with investors?</strong>
        
        <br /> Asked everyone he knew. Everyone. Friends of friends too.<br /> Find similarities to their older investments<br /> Use LinkedIn too.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Any trouble or best practices converting to conversations?<br /> </strong>Little blurb to read and/or forward.<br /> Short short preso, 3-5pgs, very few words.<br /> Give this to both contacts and investors.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>What was key to getting first term sheet?<br /> </strong>We had one of our best pitches to BlueRun. Made a lot of sense, investor was excited. Were talking term sheet the next day.<br /> &#8220;I&#8217;m not entirely sure it was the very next day, but they brought up the words term sheet etc. We probably got it a day or two later.&#8221;<br /> You do a lot of pitches. Sometimes they stump you, or you mess up, or you say something differently. That one just went really well.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>You said you created a syndicate. How did you create it and why? (What&#8217;s the diff between a syndicate and just &#8220;some angels&#8221;)<br /> </strong>Just got people together who didn&#8217;t know who each other were. Eventually introduce them to each other so they can hash things out.<br /> Hash out: who&#8217;s going to get the board seat? we&#8217;re not going to give out two.<br /> One gets the board seat for same amt of money? Re-adjust. This is biggest problem with 2 institutional investors.<br /> Adv of syndicate: they move faster, put in less money. One problem with putting too many people in: it won&#8217;t be worth any one person&#8217;s time to help you out.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Is there any search type site that maps what you&#8217;re looking for to investors?<br /> </strong>Nope. Brute force researching every investor you can think of <img src='http://staringispolite.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br /> AngelList is probably the closest thing.<br /> Find investors interested in your space, but who don&#8217;t already have a conflicting investment.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>How did you decide on amount raising and valuation?<br /> </strong>One of their investors for Series A thought 500k would be wasted money, thought they would only get through legal but not product proof. That pushed it to 1M, then 2 institutional investors wanted in so it was 700k each.<br /> Later: used engagement to prove value. Couldn&#8217;t get a ton of engagement traction in time, so used institutional BD opportunities. They work with 65 institutions but they still can barely get them to move on marketing.<br /> &#8220;We used our engagement/bd opportunities to raise the 2nd round. It you have a product that people love its a HUGE win.&#8221;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Advice on closing?<br /> </strong>Don&#8217;t get nit picky on valuation or equity. 1-2% isn&#8217;t going to break anything. Same with convertible note vs other options. 10% equity difference sure, but they&#8217;re job isn&#8217;t to screw you. Goal is to get the term sheet.<br /> They paid $30,000 for VC&#8217;s lawyer fees. This is common. Keep in mind for the round.

      <div>
        <strong>How do you quantify how interested they are?</strong>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        They assumed everyone was interested unless they said no.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        Followed up with the same engagement as super warm investors.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        At one point they had a meeting with True where more people came in and asked tons of questions. Took this as a good sign. (Note that this wasn&#8217;t a bad thing, just an anecdote. &#8220;True are amazing. Maybe it was that it felt like it was about to close that it made it that more dramatic. &#8221;<br /> Blue Run didn&#8217;t have a similar step in SaveUp&#8217;s process.
      </div>
      
      <div>
        One that stuck with him was &#8220;can you hire? can you lead a team&#8221;
      </div>
      
      <div>
           Prove that out, name drop who you know that might help you, been working in the valley for X years, etc
      </div>
      
      <div>
      </div>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <div>
        <strong>What&#8217;s behind numbers? (eg. target valuation, amt raising, etc)</strong>
      </div>
      
      <div>
           Have hiring plan prepared. What are you gonna use money for?
      </div>
      
      <div>
           What do you need to do to show success? (Hire this much of this roles, how much will that cost you personally at market salary/equity. It&#8217;ll take this long.)
      </div>
      
      <div>
           Don&#8217;t care about most smaller stuff. Unless it&#8217;s like 1/5th of the money?
      </div>
      
      <div>
           Salaries will be biggest portion of costs.
      </div>
      
      <div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        
        <div>
          <strong>Worked well for them:</strong>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          Create a syndicate
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <div>
            350k is middle end. 1M
          </div>
          
          <div>
            Look at ~$100,000 from one lead angel
          </div>
          
          <div>
            (Clarification: &#8220;Getting 100k from an angel will be super hard unless they are a super angel. Angel rounds vary in size, so it really depends on the amount of super angels you have.&#8221;)
          </div>
          
          <div>
            Just take meetings, talk to them. At least you can leave with &#8220;do you know anyone else who&#8217;d be interested in this deal?&#8221;
          </div>
          
          <div>
            Spreadsheet; highlight people they knew personally; people we wanted to talk to; people they were friend
          </div>
          
          <div>
                Track when the VCs investor meeting is, follow up after.
          </div>
          
          <div>
            If you&#8217;re not raising soon, tell them. Otherwise it&#8217;s a negative sign when you come back in a few months.
          </div>
          
          <div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        
        <div>
          <strong>What didn&#8217;t work for them:<br /> </strong>Investors didn&#8217;t get the lottery thing, how bad the engagement was for Mint-type sites,<br /> They said come back with traction, or with users, or with monetization
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>

        <strong>Me: Anything the Founders Dojo community can provide you (Sammy), let us know<br /> </strong>Was fun in its own right!<br /> Info on how things are going.<br /> Keeping tabs on the investment field is valuable to him in general.
