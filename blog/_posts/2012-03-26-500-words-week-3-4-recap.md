Last week, I wrote these bullet points down. I had planned to do it Monday, but on Monday about <a title="How it feels when EVERYONE you know gets laid off" href="http://staringispolite.com/blog/2012/03/20/how-it-feels-when-everyone-you-know-gets-laid-off/" target="_blank">100 of 114 people at my last company were laid off</a>, which changed most of the week&#8217;s plans. Some of these still make sense and none of them ever became a proper post for last week:

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Feel like while I did the words every morning, I felt like I don&#8217;t accomplish as much as week 1.
    </li>
    <li>
      Didn&#8217;t put my thoughts from last Sunday (week 2) to practice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Didn&#8217;t go back and read them, maybe that would&#8217;ve helped.
    </li>
    <li>
      Think I also front loaded a lot of productivity by putting off other life things (returning my kindle, turning art, and trunk club packages; haircut; social stuff).
    </li>
    <li>
      Also did steak night which took up all morning and most of evening productivity after Tues so maybe that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m feeling.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    I think for the most part those points still stand. I&#8217;ve let myself slip on some of the details of the experiment, due to one part <!--more-->settling into a slightly-incorrect routine, one part major external events breaking said routine completely. I never did the week 3 recap, didn&#8217;t follow the &#8220;1 personal topic per day&#8221; rule half of last week, and totally blew it on the &#8220;in bed, reading, by midnight&#8221; front. It&#8217;s 11:56pm as I write this sentence, so I&#8217;m on track for a perfect 7 out of 7 for messing that one up. I wouldn&#8217;t say I regret the decisions I made last week either, to see my Lolapps friends more, stay out later with them than I normally would, or to forgo some of the rules to optimize for helping them out or spreading the word. Of course it doesn&#8217;t hurt that my blog got 20,000 views in the process, which I count as a win for the site and for publicizing the story. But the upshot in terms of reflecting on the experiment&#8217;s progress is: pretty much the exact same issues as last week. So I&#8217;ll address each of them
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      <em>Felt like I don&#8217;t accomplish as much as week 1.</em><br /> Well for one thing, week one was the lowest hanging fruit possible. I went from making no visible progress on my personal site for years, to a blog and minimal redesign, in about an hour. These kinds of wins, and getting re-inspired to accomplish things I&#8217;ve been putting off in my life will be hard to replicate without letting some area stagnate for just as long. So there&#8217;s an element of &#8220;chasing the dragon&#8221; there. <strong>This feeling will likely come back when I move on to my next three goals.</strong> For now, just focus on finally being absolutely 100% done with the first three goals. If making progress on these goals felt great, being 100% done with them will be a huge load off my mind.<br /> EDIT: Interestingly, I had forgotten that in my <a title="500 Words. Week 2 Recap." href="http://staringispolite.com/blog/2012/03/12/500-words-week-2-recap/">Week 2 Recap</a>, I actually WANTED to do less each week, in favor of leaving more time for unexpected events or catching up with friends, etc. So, this isn&#8217;t really a problem except that now we&#8217;re in the last week and stuff needs to get finalized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Didn&#8217;t put my thoughts from week 2 to practice.</em><br /> Now that things have calmed down in other parts of my life (steak night successfully accomplished; Lolapps fallout dying down) I should be able to re-focus. Sleep is also huge here. If I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;m much more likely to get stuck in a consumer mindset. <strong>The better I am with sleep the better I&#8217;ll be with everything else. Gotta put that into effect.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Maybe it would&#8217;ve helped to re-read the weekly re-caps. </em><br /> Another benefit of week 1 was, with everything being so fresh, it&#8217;s easier to keep everything in your head. Try this: <strong>go back over each week re-cap once a day</strong> to re-focus on the right things.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Think I also front loaded a lot of productivity. </em><br /> Anecdotally this seems true. Things like taxes, haircuts, errands are coming up more now, so make sure in my head <strong>it&#8217;s ok to not replicate that 1st week&#8217;s productivity all the time</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Steak night took up lots of time in week 3.<br /> </em>And the Lolapps news took a lot of time in week 4. That&#8217;s over, so the score resets. This week the challenge will be work, so <strong>I need to be extra vigilant about sleep & distractions.</strong>
