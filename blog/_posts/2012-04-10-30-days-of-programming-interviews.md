I’m starting a new 30 days experiment! This time with my good friend from University of Maryland, Koffi Kpetigo. Each week we’re picking one chapter from this book on programming interview questions: [Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions](http://amzn.to/HhSusG)

Each chapter is themed (Arrays & Strings, Object Oriented Design, etc) so each week will be a focus on one of our top four topics. If it goes great after 30 days, then we&#8217;ll keep going until every chapter is done. Each morning, I&#8217;m waking up at the same time as before (8:30am) and doing a one-hour interview as if someone were asking me questions from that chapter. Then I&#8217;ll attempt to document that effort here, for posterity. Then, once a week, we&#8217;ll call each other up and do phone screens on questions from the &#8220;Medium&#8221; and &#8220;Hard&#8221; chapters (which are miscellaneous unthemed chapters that seem to represent the kinds of questions I&#8217;ve actually been asked in interviews.) The weeks are going to be this ordering, with today being Day 1 of the first week:

Week 1 &#8211; Chap 7: OO Design
  
Week 2 &#8211; Chap 3: Stacks & Queues
  
Week 3 &#8211; Chap 4: Trees & Graphs
  
Week 4 &#8211; Chap 9: Sorting and Searching

I expect I&#8217;ll get two things out of it, with hopefully a few surprise leanings thrown in as we go:

  1. **More confidence in a variety of interview questions**. Right now I typically go in to an interview with the belief that I&#8217;ll be able to figure out most problems, and a solid (though not perfect) understanding of common data structures. But I&#8217;ve never studied interview questions themselves, so I always feel like there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m missing. I&#8217;m definitely not one of those people who remembers their sorting algorithms, and I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m at the point where I can say something like &#8220;Ok, this question falls into <question grouping>, which usually depends on <data structure here>, and they&#8217;re really looking to see if I can <thought process here>.&#8221; Even though I&#8217;ve been on the other side of interviewing for years, I still don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve &#8220;pulled back the curtain&#8221; 100%. This should change that, or at least start.
  2. **A couple new interview questions to use myself.** I&#8217;ve been using the same one or two interview questions for a couple years now, and I&#8217;d like to switch it up. I like my current favorite a lot: it starts with basic algorithms, expands requirements in the middle, and ends up in a larger systems design conversation. But two problems I have with it are: (1) if you&#8217;ve heard a similar question for the algorithm part before, you&#8217;ll get further, and it&#8217;s close enough to a more common interview question that that&#8217;s happened a few times. I can correct for this, but I&#8217;d like to not have to. (2) I&#8217;d like to ask a harder initial question in general, so I can make a more granular evaluation of the top candidates.

Here we go!
