Just got back from a fun and inspiring night at IDEO, who hosted <a href="http://designplusstartup.com/" target="_blank">Design+Startup</a> (an ongoing series of design and hacking talks with lots of pizza and booze mixed in). Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/madisonmount" target="_blank">@madisonmount</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/phineasb" target="_blank">@phineasb</a> for hosting. Below are my notes from the event&#8217;s talks. They&#8217;re mostly in stream of consciousness form, though I do make some attempt to organize them. Many past events can be found in video form (nicely separated into separate talks) on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/firstroundcapital" target="_blank">First Round&#8217;s Youtube channel</a>.

I hope these can be a helpful resource. Final note: I love talking design and hacking. If you went tonight, or want to discuss, find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/staringispolite" target="_blank">@staringispolite</a>.

Tools = potential
  
They&#8217;re also all terrible! But remember how bad it was in 2000.
  
[Image of his first website: 8-bit graphics! Warcraft! Animated gifs!]
  
Ex: making a web app in 2000: No Heroku. No hosting providers. WTF is a server

A GIVEN HUMAN&#8217;S POTENTIAL IS FIXED
  
Picture a graph where X-axis is skill type, Y-axis is level of mastery
  
Any one human has a certain &#8220;height&#8221; of a bar graph bar to spend on mastery across as many skills as they like. More skills = less likely any one can reach proficiency or mastery though. Classic trade-off.
  
Two levels on the Y-axis represent proficiency (middle) and mastery (high; you could teach others).
  
TOOLS lower these bars over time, while the &#8220;height&#8221; any one human can &#8220;spend&#8221; on reaching any number of those stays the same.
  
Therefore, tools are enabling breadth.

USE TOOLS WITHOUT REGRET
  
New shit comes out every week. Try it. Keep what works better.
  
Don&#8217;t describe yourself by the tools you use

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 430px">

If the end product is well-designed software….
  
Why can&#8217;t you code?
  
Why can&#8217;t you design?
  
[Or marketing, or user research, or...]

GET IN TROUBLE
  
Go to places you&#8217;re very uncomfortable, places people say you shouldn&#8217;t be.
  
If you don&#8217;t, these kids are gonna ruin you [Picture of kids learning to program]

Q&A
  
How to balance breadth against progress?
  
* Think about what&#8217;s important to me, let that drive concrete progress
  
* Feel overwhelmed? Stop, turn off computer, allow everything to bubble at once, write down the most important feeling ones, use that to focus.

**Karen Kaushansky of JAWBONE on: EXPERIENCE DESIGN**
  
**<a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/kjkausha" target="_blank">@kjkausha</a> **

Def&#8217;n:
  
A form of prototyping that eagles design team members, user, and clients to gain first hand appreciation of existing or future environment of the product through active participation.

Goal:
  
In the moment, in specific ways, understand what it is to use a thing

WHAT IS IT YOU WANT THE USER TO FEEL?
  
How does it feel to wear it; to use it in X, Y, Z situations; in failure?
  
Ex: Google Glass: How does it feel to use it in presentations?
  
[Takes out a homemade Glass prototype, does a few commands, demonstrates that sometimes you say "glass" but don't want it to wake up]

<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 308px">
  <a href="https://twitter.com/jenrikay/status/347586747892383744/photo/1"><img class="     " src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BNLgTj1CQAEKl3u.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="298" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Karen's impressive glass prototype
  </p>
</div>

[Asks audience how it FELT to watch her use it, or how it'd FEEL to do it themselves. Most emotions listed aren't positive]
  
Note that none of these are use cases for Glass, and waking it up doesn&#8217;t matter. But point stands: When asked, crowd agrees it feels silly to use in front of people; one wonders if they considered this context, what they want people to feel, or what emotions are in the design brief.

Recommends talks by Tom Chi on Glass rapid prototypes.
  
Looks like many of them are things you could make at home.

Give to people, have them use in context
  
For physical products, take home. For digital things, use where it makes sense
  
Even if it doesn&#8217;t work yet
  
Have them keep a journal of things you&#8217;re feeling or doing; photos
  
Groups; build off each other in sharing (after individual usage, ideation)

EXPERIENCE IN CONTEXT because people USE IT IN CONTEXT

&#8220;There are no boundaries to being a leader&#8221; -Shawn Fanning
  
+1 to GET IN TROUBLE.

Q&A
  
How do you deal with &#8220;experience in context&#8221; if you&#8217;re not the target customer?
  
* Find anyone new who hasn&#8217;t experienced the product yet. Anyone, works with you or not.
  
What if you don&#8217;t have anyone applicable? e.g. medical device for deaf people
  
\* Can you \*simulate* being deaf? Put stuff in your ears then wear it? Empathize or simulate whenever possible.

**Vivian Barad of IDEO on: MANUFACTURING**
  
Story of building a bike bag for Thule (swedish lifestyle company)

TALK TO PEOPLE
  
Go on Craigslist, find people who can talk to you about bikes (wish there were more detail on this)
  
Observe bikes around the city
  
What bags are out there now

Lots of cool anecdotes about nailing details down once they had the form they wanted.
  
Went IRL to the factory in China, many backs and forths

IF SOMETHING IS TRULY IMPORTANT &#8211; FIGHT FOR IT
  
They fought for welded fabrics. important for durability, waterproofing.
  
Factory bought equipment, learned it, now has competitive edge
  
There was some in the reverse direction as well.

<a name="datavis"></a>
  
**Brad Simpson of IDEO on: DATA VIS / TELLING A STORY**

Day in the life of the T
  
MBTA opened up 1 day of data for a vis competition

1st step: clean data so the team had a solid foundation/communication
  
Designer made up data so you could plug his real data in later and it&#8217;d look pretty
  
He made ugly data so he could find patterns/stories.
  
Tons of crude graphs to see if any visual patterns
  
Seems fundamental to have designers and eng and each discipline in from the beginning

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Early directions each member of the team went.
  </p>
</div>

&nbsp;

Language fight! Openframeworks or processing?  <img src='http://staringispolite.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

Prototyping digitally is about exploration
  
UNCOVER THE STORY YOU WANT TO TELL WHILE YOU&#8217;RE TELLING IT
  
(launch to learn)

Q&A:
  
What were the moments you went from throwing data at the wall to the story you wanted to tell and how to show it?
  
* Super organic. Just hanging out, putting stuff on a TV and talk about what you feel about how interesting things are

What tools would you use NOW?
  
* Tools you&#8217;re familiar with are the ones for early prototypes. You&#8217;re going to rewrite it all anyway
  
* Prob web tools now b/c sharing is so fundamentally important

When the pen met code (a love story)
  
I love old mechanical junk (side project)

Side projects: No process. Just play.
  
Wanted to do something arty, not an artist though (though he supposes everyone can be an artist)

</div>

1st project, copying &#8220;Cubic disarray&#8221;

2nd project: self-portrait
  
wrote the driver for it himself (coordinate, marker down, move to coordinate 2, etc)
  
web cam grab, algorithm to translate to line drawing in lines
  
humans too hard, try owls?

    "Mystery Owl". Went to sleep at 4am, found this in the morning. Doesn't remember printing it. (Do you think ghost owls go "whooOOOOoOOoooo"? I digress)
  </p>
</div>

Tried different algos to add detail where needed (eyes, ears)

Moral of the story: let fun guide you sometimes, regardless of quality

How to &#8220;do everything&#8221; e.g. work autonomously
  
Worst trap of context switching you&#8217;ve ever dealt with
  
It just really sucks. But it&#8217;s also super fun and challenging
  
Work in chunks
  
Computers are great at context switching, our brains are not.

You CAN get everything &#8220;done&#8221; as the companies sole designer (quotes -> nothing&#8217;s ever &#8220;done&#8221;)

1 &#8211; AVOID BEING THE SOLE SOURCE OF IDEAS
  
Don&#8217;t fool yourself into thinking that all the best ideas will be yours.

* Design leadership is about cultivating ideas
  
* Co-workers are often your first users. Engage them.
  
* Even best designers on dribbble etc don&#8217;t have your context or priorities

2 &#8211; FACILITATE A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT
  
It&#8217;s your ball. Run with it.

* If you ask someone for their feedback they will later ask for yours
  
* The habits of early employees inform the culture of the company
  
* If you want something to be, start doing it.

3 &#8211; DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT.
  
&#8220;Good for now&#8221; earns opportunities for &#8220;great&#8221; later on.

* &#8220;There is no state of the world where [no product] is better than [product].&#8221;
  
* Don&#8217;t be afraid of design debt
  
* Don&#8217;t lose your ego, but learn when to check it.
  
* Just like technical debt.

Q&A

Paying down design debt?
  
* Keep track of things in Asana
  
* Think through enough so that if you DO get a day to pay down a bit, you GO
  
* Don&#8217;t let it get so bad it hurts the main goals.

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    ex. Betable's homepage - he designed it; he hates it.
  </p>
</div>

Priorities are, in order: Legal stuff. Developer sign up. Capture errant end-users for marketing later.
  
That&#8217;s it.
  
It&#8217;s ok that he hates it, b/c priorities are building the dev/game channel first and context is the players won&#8217;t stay if dev/game channel doesn&#8217;t exist (or if company doesn&#8217;t exist b/c you spent too long on the homepage).
