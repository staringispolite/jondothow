Everything I can think of that I want to do, so it doesn&#8217;t keep rattling around in my head. These will eventually make it into goals and get done. All in due time&#8230;

**Work**

  * Mobile &#038; HTML5 apps
  * Strategy/product direction
  * Inbox Zero

**Side-projects**

  * SevenUp
  * LikePython
  * My own personal site
  * RecruitingFail.wordpress.com
  * Clean out google reader; actually follow the blogs of people I respect
  * More hackathons (hang out with founder friends more often. Compete?)

**Personal / Social Life**

  * Activities
  * Exploring the city (places I haven&#8217;t been before)
  * Generally check out what happening in the area on a regular basis. If I don&#8217;t make a goal out of this it just doesn&#8217;t happen.
  * Standup and other comedy
  * Seeing friends who are in the SF area
  * Traveling to see friends who aren&#8217;t
  * See family more
  * Wine tasting; learn more about wine & what I like / don&#8217;t like.
  * Minted Steak Night

  * Music
  * Guitar (Songs, scales, chords, improvisation. Would love to learn the blues better)
  * Turntables (Beatmatching, scratching, make some mix tapes where songs actually flow together well).
  * Voice lessons
  * My drum set I have to leave at my parents house (get an electric one?)
  * Recording
  * Submit to have Michael Tolcher play at our apartment. (2012 is a year of him doing this around the country)

  * Language
  * Practice my French more (watch French TV, movies, news; Rosetta Stone; talk to friends in French, or I&#8217;ve heard there are Meetups for French practice?)
  * Learn basic Spanish (Rosetta Stone; order food en español)

  * Art
  * Digital painting, especially concept art
  * Figure drawing / life drawing
  * 3D modeling
  * Texturing
  * ✔ Getting to know the Minted community
  * Graphic design

  * Books
  * ✔ Game of Thrones
  * Lonesome Dove (Pulitzer Prize, came recommended
  * Predictably Irrational
  * Drive
  * The Steve Jobs Biography
  * How to Win Friends and Influence People (Great book on relationships with people, not being a dick as the title might suggest. Re-read periodically)
  * Quiet: The Power of Introverts, by Susan Cain (Recommended by my mom, &#8220;proudly introverted since 1954&#8243;)
  * The Dune series

  * Make time to play games with no agenda
  * StarCraft 2
  * Rockband / Guitar hero

  * General life goodness
  * Inbox Zero
  * Keep in touch better with old friends even when you can&#8217;t be home / see them in person.

**Health**

  * Dance classes & jams (hip hop, popping classes around the city; competitions in the area)
  * Finish reading The Perfect Health Diet
  * Cook more for myself, eat healthier as a habit
  * Sleep study
