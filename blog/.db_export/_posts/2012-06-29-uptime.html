<p>Dear diary: Almost 54 days without restarting my Macbook Pro.</p>
<p>Skype's chat UI changes when I unplug the power; Chrome has begun aribtrarily turning webpages to flat white. There are equally bizarre workarounds for each, but I am finally giving in and restarting.</p>
<p>Goodnight, sweet prince. You've had a good run.</p>
