In response to my question on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r62jp/iama_nasa_astronaut_that_recently_returned_to/" target="_blank">his reddit IAMA</a>, astronaut Ron Garan linked to this post he wrote on how it feels to plunge back to Earth from the ISS after more than 5 months in space. I found it incredibly interesting.

Some quotes that stood out especially, to me:<!--more-->

> We all strapped into the same seats we occupied when we launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome **in Kazakhstan**
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> We approached Earth at a steep angle, at just under **5 miles per second
  
>** 
> 
> It was wonderful to speak with my family in Houston while we were all on **the same planet
  
>** 
> 
> &#8230;the realization that I would see **only one sunset each day**, instead of sixteen
